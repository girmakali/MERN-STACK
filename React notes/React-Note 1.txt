- Slow development
- hard to scale while in complex projects (hard to manage with team of developers)

React: 
     - Built by Facebook (FB, Instagram & Netflix)
     - can be used in mobile devices (native) and VR
     

     N.B
         - Components                : to write reusable, modular,and better organized code
         - one way Data flow
         - Virtual Dom
         - Eco-System (many tools works with React)
